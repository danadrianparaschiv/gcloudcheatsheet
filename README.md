# gcloudcheatsheet
Based on Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification exam guide I am putting together a cheat sheet for gcloud  command.

What is it?

A learning tool for getting up to speed with Google Cloud services and concepts via gcloud CLI. It is closely aligned with Associate Cloud Engineer
certification exam guide https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-engineer


How to use it?

In case you are not familiar with a particular topic you can start with links listed under Reference.
After that you could start a cloud shell from Google cloud console, by clicking the Activate Cloud Shell button and run the gcloud commands under each topic.

For some for the commands you should mind the notes below (eg. "project_id parameter has to be unique").


What's next?

I plan to add some additional tasks/todos that can be performed for each topic, that would extend the knowledge and experience on the topic beyond the requirements of the certification exam.
